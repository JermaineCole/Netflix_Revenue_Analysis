# **Analysis of Revenue Impact Based on Device Usage Across Demographic Segments**

**Stakeholder Objective:**

The finance department has requested an in-depth analysis to evaluate how various devices contribute to the companyâ€™s overall revenue, with a focus on demographic factors such as age and gender. The primary aim is to identify whether specific devices are driving higher revenue within particular demographic groups. Furthermore, the team seeks to explore potential opportunities for optimising device-targeted marketing strategies and content delivery to maximise revenue generation within these user segments.
